From time to time it's a good idea to take a break from the testing, to clear
you head or to think about great new ideas. This break can be a coffee with
colleagues, short walk around the office, or a game. What game do you ask?
Well, it should be definitely a game which has something in common with
what we do!

Run the following command:
./runtux.sh

Surprise! :)

Guide the Tux to the next level...
