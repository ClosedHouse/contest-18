You'll get to the next level using this command:

$ next-level [code]
    where [code] is in format OH18_something

You can try following example:

$ next-level OH18_NEXT

Each level has its own directory indexed from 0 (which is the current level).
After successfully executing the next-level command with a correct code, just
jump to the next directory in the order.
